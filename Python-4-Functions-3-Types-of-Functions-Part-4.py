# function returning 'None'
# even though fun returns 'None' by default, it is still classified as a function  that carries out a task
# 'None' is a obj that represents the absence of a value 
# all functions return 'None' by default, unless you specifically return a value 

def greet(name): 
  print (f"Hello {name}")

greet("Astra Rai")  
print(greet("Astra Rai"))
print(type(None)) # class ????

# date May 16, 2021, I don't fully understand the concept behind "None"...review again in a few days
