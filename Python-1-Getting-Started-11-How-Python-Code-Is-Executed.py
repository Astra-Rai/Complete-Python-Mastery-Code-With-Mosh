# How Python Code is Executed

# C Complier converts C code into Machine Code
# Machine code is specific to the type of processor of a computer ....
# If C code is complied on windows, cannot execute on Mac
# Java complier complier complies code into Java Bytecode which is not specific to a hardware platform, like Windows or Mac
# Java code/program -> complier -> Java Bytecode -> Java Virtual Machine -> Machine Code
# JVM loads Java byte code and at run time, it converts each instruction to Machine code ...
# This allows Java byte code on any platform that hhas JVM
# C# and Pyton are platform independent 
# How CPython Works..
# Python program / code, -> Cypthon -> Python Bytecode -> Python VM - Machine Code
# Python implementations: Jython: Java, ItonPython: C#, PyPy: Subset of Pythoon
# Jython: instead of instead of compling python code into python byte code, it's complied to Java byte code ..
# Java byte code and run it using Java VM, Java byte code will eventually execute by JVM
