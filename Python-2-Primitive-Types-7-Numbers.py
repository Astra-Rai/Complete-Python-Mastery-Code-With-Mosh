# numbers

# types of numbers in python: intergers, floats and complex numbers 
a = 1 # integer
b = 1.1 # float


# syntax for complex numbers
# math synax x = a + bi, where ' i '' is an imiginary, in python 'j ' is used instead of i

x = 1 + 2j # where j is the imiginary number

# standard Arithmetic operators

print(10 + 3) # addition, 13
print(10 - 3) # subtraction, 7
print(10 * 3) # multiplication, 30
print(10 / 3) # division, 3.333...35, can get a float
print(10 // 3) # division, 3,  interger only no floats 
print(10 % 3) # modulus operator, 1, this is the remainder


# argument assignment operator

y = 10
y = 10 + 3 # increment y by 3
print(y) #13


z = 15 
z += 3 #increment z by three
print(z) #18
