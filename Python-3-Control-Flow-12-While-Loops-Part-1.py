# while loops: used to repeat something as long as a condition is true

# example 1
# while number is greater than zero, if condition is true, divide 'number' by 2in each interation? divide by half
# 100/2 = 50, 50/2 = 25, 25/2= 15.5

number = 100 #define a variable 'number' and set it to 100
# while looop used to evaluate a condition and repeat a task
while number > 0: # while number is greater than zero, divide number
  print(number) # with indentation, we can repeat 1 or more statements
  number //= 2 # same as: number = number // 2, use agumented assignment operator to shorten code

# In Python, there are two types of division operators:

# / : Divides the number on its left by the number on its right and returns a floating point value.

# // : Divides the number on its left by the number on its right, rounds down the answer, and returns a whole number.
